### Hey there! I'm Ryan, a Full-Stack Developer and UC Irvine CS alum.

I love both computer science and design, and am interested in areas where these passions intersect, such as front-end web/app development and UI/UX design! I'm a strong believer in making products as elegant and intuitive as they are functional, and you'll see this philosophy appear in every product I've developed. Explore my pinned repositories to see a bit of what I've done so far ðŸ‘€
